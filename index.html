					<h2>Services</h2>
					<p>This Project is aimed to make Healthcare system in West Bengal More Accesible and much more
						affordable. Often When We Visit Medical Health Checkup Clinics Or Hospitals We Need To Pay A
						certain Visiting Fees to get ourself diagnosed and no matter how big or small of a health issue
						you have this fees is compulsory. Although a significant amount of people who visit medical
						facilities often suffer from minute to no illness at all. Our Website/App Helps Provide People
						With free Diagnosis Of Patients Based On their symptoms.Once they are diagnosed we can further
						narrow down these possibilities by asking user about the specifics of their symptoms such as
						duration of the symptom or severity and thus provide the user with the most appropriate
						medication for that illness( as prescribed by certified doctors of the state ) at the same time
						we will suggest the best doctors available for the user for that particular illness. And at the
						same time we will also suggest popular home remedies for users who dont want to undergo any
						expert treatment or in case of emergency. While we appear to provide users the best doctors
						available for their
						treatment, we will also provide users with the cost of treatment,the mode of treatment
						available(online,offline) and the timings of availability for respective doctors.
